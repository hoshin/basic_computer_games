# Foreword

This repo will contain some games from the "BASIC computer games" (David H. Ahl - 1978), recreated in CLI / maybe a web app / electron app, depending on what I want to experiment. I think I'll always implement a CLI version first and then maybe another one for kicks.

This is based on Jeff Atwood's tweet (https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/1351289297760968705).

I'm doing this a a fun thing to do whenever I feel like coding for a while so don't expect me to cover the whole book in 2 weeks ;) I'll implement the games I want at the pace I want, this will be a way to get some practice, maybe try stuff out also. Anyhow, for thos of you that'd stumble upon this at some point : enjoy what you find there!
